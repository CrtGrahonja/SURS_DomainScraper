# scraping_JobPortals
Programs and documentation regarding scraping of Job Portals. This project runs in Python 3.4 or more. It is **not** supported in Python 2.7. It also uses a *selenium* simulation browser. Without it, the project will not run correctly. 

In our case this is a Mozilla Firefox browser which additionally needs a geckodriver executable. **It is recommended that you use a browser of version 72.0.2 (Firefox Quantum) and a geckodriver version 0.26.0**

## I would advise to prevent automatic updating for these programs, otherwise the scraping may fail.
###### *Keep in mind that all internet domains, paths to directories and files, file names and HTML tags are examples and should be changed before use.*
